  <h1>JAM - The Java API for Metadata</h1>

  <p>
    JAM is an object model for Java types and their associated annotations.
    It provides a superset of the features offered by similar APIs
    (such as Reflection or X/Javadoc), including a unique extensibility
    mechanism specifically designed to help Java developers cope with the
    rapidly-changing world of Java metadata.

  <p>
    The implementation you can download now is code complete, and
    is passing regression tests of its basic functionality.  However, 
    it is still stabilizing from a significant refactoring that I recently
    completed, so there are bound to be some bad bugs in areas that
    the tests don't yet cover.  In particular, I don't believe the JSR175
    annotation support is working properly yet, but I will have that
    fixed shortly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that JAM currently is still packaged under 
    <code>org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.jam</code>.  I know this looks weird,
    and I am going to change it as soon as I now where JAM is going
    to live permanently.

<h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>
    JAM has evolved as part my work on 
    <a href='http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans'>XML-Beans</a> at Apache,
    which I do on behalf of my employer, 
    <a href='http://www.bea.com'>BEA Systems</a>.
    In XML-Beans, I need to be able model Java types in order to generate
    XML schemas from them.  I found all of the existing Java object models
    (x/javadoc, reflection, qdox) to be lacking in 
    some respect.  They each have some features I wanted, but none of them 
    brought all of those features together.  Perhaps more importantly,
    though, none of them provide a migration path from javadoc-based
    metadata to JSR175, which is a big concern for me.  JAM was written
    to fill this void.
  </p>

  <p>
    JAM is now proving to be a generally useful technology in its
    own right.  Most notably, it is already being used in Cedric Beust's 
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/ejbgen'>EJBgen</a> and
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/sgen'>SGen</a>.  Accordingly, I am now
    spinning it up as a distinct open source project, but it doesn't yet
    have an official open source community.   Until it does, my website here
    is serving as a temporary home.
