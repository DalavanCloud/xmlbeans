  <h1>JAM - The Java API for Metadata</h1>

  <p>
    JAM is an object model for Java types and their associated annotations.
    It provides a superset of the features offered by other similar APIs
    (such as Reflection or X/Javadoc), including a unique extensibility
    mechanism specifically designed to help Java developers cope with the
    rapidly-changing world of Java metadata.

  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>
    JAM has evolved as part my work on 
    <a href='http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans'>XML-Beans</a> at Apache.
    There, I needed to be able model Java types in order to generate
    XML schemas from them.  I found all of the existing
    Java object models (javadoc, reflection, xdoclet) to be lacking in 
    some respect.  They all had features I wanted, but none of them had
    all of the features I wanted. And none of them provide a smooth
    upgrade path from javadoc-based annotations to JSR175, which is a big
    concern for me.
  </p>

  </p>
    However, it is proving to be a generally useful technology in its
    own right.  (Most notably, it is already being used in Cedric Beust's 
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/ejbgen'>EJBgen</a> and
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/sgen'>SGen</a>).  Accordingly, I am now
    spinning up JAM as a distinct open source project.  Until that is
    done, my website here is serving to provide an early-access look at JAM.
