      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>
        Before installing XMLBeans, you will need to have JDK 1.4 installed
        and <link href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</link>.  Once you have
        those, continue with the steps below.
      </p>
    </section>
		<section>
			<title>Download XMLBeans</title>
			<p>To start out, you'll need the XMLBeans binaries. You can get these in one of two ways:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>To get started more quickly, you can 
			<link href="../sourceAndBinaries/index.html#XMLBeans+Binary+and+Development+Kit">Download the
			XMLBeans release.</link></li>
			<li>If you're interested, you can also <link href="../sourceAndBinaries/index.html#XMLBeans+Source">build 
			from the source</link>.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Set Environment Variables</title>
			<p>After downloading and unzipping XMLBeans, you'll need to add environment variables that allow you to 
			use the XMLBeans tools and binaries.</p>
			<p>The following instructions assume you're using the XMLBeans release, whose directory structure looks 
			like this:</p>
			<source>&lt;xmlbeans-version&gt;
    bin (location of tools)
    docs
    lib (location of xbean.jar)
    ...</source>
<p>If you're building from source, paths will differ slightly (note the location of xbean.jar). You should account for this when setting up your environment.</p>
			<source>&lt;xmlbeans-version&gt;
    bin (location of tools)
    build
        ...
        lib (location of xbean.jar)
        ...</source>
		<section>
			<title>Windows Setup</title>
			<p>On Windows, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Right-click <strong>My Computer</strong>, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>.</li>
				<li>Add an <code>XMLBEANS_HOME</code> variable whose value is the XMLBeans location. 
				<p>For example, if you downloaded the XMLBeans release to the root of your C drive, this might 
				be <code>c:\xmlbeans-1.0.2.</code></p></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>PATH</code> variable so that it includes the bin directory of your XMLBeans 
				installation. For the XMLBeans release, you could add <code>%XMLBEANS_HOME%\bin</code>.</li>
				<li>Edit the <code>CLASSPATH</code> variable to include the xbean.jar included with XMLBeans. 
				<p>This is located in the lib directory. If you built XMLBeans from source, you can also use the 
				JAR file in the build/ar or build/lib directories.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note that you may also need to edit your PATH variable so that the JDK is earlier in the path. For more 
			information, see the <jump href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlbeans/XmlBeansV1Faq#scompFindingJavac">XMLBeans 
			FAQ</jump>.</p>
			</section>
		<section>
			<title>UNIX/Linux Setup</title>
			<p>On UNIX/Linux, update your environment as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><code>export XMLBEANS_HOME=&lt;location of XMLBeans root&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>export PATH=$PATH:$XMLBEANS_HOME/bin</code></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Your updates might look like this:</p>
			<source>export XMLBEANS_HOME=/Users/me/xmlstuff/xmlbeans-1.0.2
export PATH=$PATH:$XMLBEANS_HOME/bin</source>
			</section>
				<p>Once you've updated your environment paths, you should be set up to use the tools that come with XMLBeans. 
				These include a schema compiler, an instance validator, and more.</p>
				<p>To get started understanding and using XMLBeans, 
				see <link href="../docs/guide/conGettingStartedwithXMLBeans.html">Getting Started with XMLBeans</link>.</p>
